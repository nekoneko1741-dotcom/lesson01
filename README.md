# Practice for GitHub

This repository is for my GitHub practice in class. I'm following the steps below and keeping notes for myself.

- Create GitHub account
  - Click the account icon and choose `Setting`.
  - Click `Developer setting` on the left menu.
  - Click `Personal access tokens : Tokens (classic)` on the left menu.
  - Click `Generate new token : Generate new token (classic)` in the top of screen.
  - Fill `note` as a small text to distinguish tokens.
  - Check `repo`.
  - Click the green button on the bottom of page as `Generate token`.
  - Make sure to copy the token like `ghp_UyAV....` and to paste it to your memo.
This line is added in Lesson 2.
